"""Defines an interface for contexts, which hold the core components that a plugin will operate upon when running.

These include a `memory` container which holds a series of forest of layers, and a `symbol_space` which contains tables
of symbols that can be used to interpret data in a layer.  The context also provides some convenience functions, most
notably the object constructor function, `object`, which will construct a symbol on a layer at a particular offset.
